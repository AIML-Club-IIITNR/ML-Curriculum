# ML-Curriculum
Aggregated resources for learning data science, machine learning and deep learning.


***[Update 10th August 2020] -***  Kaggle has recently launched [30 Days of ML](https://www.kaggle.com/thirty-days-of-ml) challenge, where youâ€™ll receive hands-on assignments delivered to your inbox. The goal of these assignments is to rapidly cover the most essential skills needed to get your hands dirty with data. You'll start by learning how to code in Python and quickly learn how to build your first machine learning model. [Start you journey here.](https://github.com/AIML-Club-IIITNR/ML-Curriculum/tree/main/Kaggle%20-%2030DOML)
